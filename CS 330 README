How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by breaking the problem into smaller parts first, then focusing on how each piece should function before worrying about polish.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me get better at designing scenes with intention, where layout, lighting, and object placement all support the overall goal.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative process where I started with a basic scene, tested it, then gradually added detail, lighting, and improvements over time.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The same approach can be used in future projects by building a working foundation first and then refining it instead of trying to design everything at once.

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach development by getting something functional early and then expanding or correcting it as I better understand the requirements.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I relied more on modular thinking, reusing similar objects and transformations rather than creating everything from scratch.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was essential, since many improvements came from testing the scene, spotting issues, and adjusting lighting, scale, or positioning.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Over the milestones, I became more comfortable refining existing code instead of rewriting it, which made progress faster and more stable.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science gives me structured problem solving skills that apply across both technical projects and long term career goals.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Working with graphics strengthened my understanding of math, spatial reasoning, and how theory translates into visual results.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
These skills are useful professionally because they improve my ability to build interactive systems, reason about performance, and communicate ideas visually.
