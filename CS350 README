1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project implemented a Raspberry Pi–based thermostat using a temperature sensor, buttons, PWM LEDs, and an LCD display. 
It solved the problem of automatically managing heating and cooling states based on a target temperature using a simple state machine.

2. What did you do particularly well?

I structured the program clearly around defined states and ensured that hardware components interacted predictably. The integration of sensor 
input, button controls, and visual feedback worked reliably together.

3. Where could you improve?

I could improve by adding more robust error handling and better abstraction between hardware control and logic. Additional testing and code 
comments would also strengthen long-term maintainability.

4. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I am becoming more comfortable using Raspberry Pi documentation, hardware datasheets, and debugging tools like serial output for troubleshooting.
These resources will continue to support future embedded projects.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

State machine design, hardware-software integration, and debugging physical components are highly transferable to other embedded systems and IoT projects.
The experience also strengthened my understanding of event-driven programming.

6. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I organized the logic around clear states and separated configuration values, such as target temperature, from control flow. This makes the system easier to 
modify, expand, or adapt for future features.
