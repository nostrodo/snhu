What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Produce a user-friendly program that displays a list of courses in order, and can show each course's prerequisite.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Most of the approach was well laid out already in assignment details. I believe most of my own contribute was with ensureing
memory management, and verifying course details and input.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Available time was alway my greatest roadblock. I managed this by staying disiplined with the schedule I laid out at the
start of class. The support of of the other members of my household went a long way as well.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I was not familiar with most of this course's contents before begining. the various searching and sorting algorithms,
analyzing each through big O notation, deciding which is optimal for the specific use case, then applying it to a final
project was all new to me.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project helped with examing and planing the apporach to the software before jumping into it, just ensure the 
solution is ideal.
