The DriverPass project was about designing a web based system for a driving school, in order to assist students with preparing for the liscense test.

The part I believe I was best at was the graphs. the use-case diagram required a couple creative solutions to enhance readability as the list of uses and the number of actors increased. I also enjoyed spending the time time and organizing the class diagram.

were I to choose one part of the work to revise, it would be the class diagram. I wasn't happy that there was a couple lines thats crisscrossed, which i believe hinder readability, and I think the packages class should've been closer to the appointment's class, 
as they are closely related.

The best way I found in interpreting the user's needs for the system was to simply write each use-case down one by one, then arrange, link, and group them together as related for the use case diagram. Working out the system visually also revealed areas of improvement
  with the original buisiness requirements document, as I noticed there really wasn't specified a way for the drivers to interact with the system and incorporate their notes for the students, despite having that feature listed as a requirement.

I think I'm still a little too new to have an established method yet. I do like planing things out, espesially visually, but ultimately experiance is the best teacher and so as long as a have a general idea of what the goal is, i try to simply hit the ground
running.
